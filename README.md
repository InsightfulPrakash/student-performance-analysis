## 📈 Key Findings

- Previous grades (G1 & G2) are strong indicators of final grade (G3)
- More study time is linked to higher scores
- Students with past failures tend to score lower
- School support and parental education have a mild positive effect
- Gender does not show significant performance difference

---
